            <p>
                O Immaculate Heart of Mary, we humbly come before you as the presidential election in November, draws
                near.<br /><br/>

                We entrust our nation, the United States of America, to your Immaculate Heart. Intercede for us, dear
                Mother, that all voters may be guided by wisdom and discernment. May they choose leaders who reflect
                justice, compassion, and integrity.<br /><br/>

                We pray for healing and unity among the people of this great nation. Help us to overcome division and
                discord, fostering a spirit of love and cooperation. May your maternal guidance inspire us to prioritize
                the common good, to seek peace, and to promote justice for all.<br /><br/>

                As we face this pivotal moment in our history, we ask that your Immaculate Heart may shine a light upon
                our paths. Protect our democracy and lead us toward a future filled with hope and prosperity. Bring us
                closer to your Son, Jesus Christ, and to a deeper commitment to serving one another. O Mary Immaculate,
                pray for us. Amen.<br /><br/>
